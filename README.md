# SuperPlay.GameServer
SuperPlay Home Assignment


Senior Server Developer exercise
Create a Net6.0 Solution with the relevant projects for the below requirements.
● Create a basic Game Server which accepts WebSockets (use Dotnet’s System.Net
only, do not use signalR or mediatR or any other lib)
○ Implement handlers for the following socket messages (all messages from client
should be sent through the socket only):
■ Login
Accept DeviceId(UDID) and response with PlayerId
● Make sure the player is not connected already, If so respond
accordingly.
■ UpdateResources
Accept ResourceType(coins, rolls), ResourceValue and Response with
new balance.
■ SendGift
Accept FriendPlayerId, ResourceType and ResourceValue.
Update the sending player’s player state and the friend player state.
If the friend is online then send a GiftEvent with the relevant information to
him.

○ Make sure that the socket messages routing can be easily extendable.
○ Player state can be saved in Ram or Sqlite.
● Create a client console Application to test the GameServer APIs.
● Use the Serilog library to effectively log both Server and Client.
● Make sure to use a clean and highly professional attitude when preparing this Solution.
Good luck!
